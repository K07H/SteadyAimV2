# Steady Aim V2

----

## Description
__Steady Aim V2__ is a mod for __Green Hell__ that allows the player to tweak aim settings precisely.

It is an enhanced version of the old SteadyAim mod from __Werkrat__.

----

## Install

### If you already have ModAPI installed:
Copy the .mod file inside directory "__[...]/modapi/mods/GH/__". Then launch __ModAPI.exe__, select "Steady Aim V2" in the left menu and click "Launch the game".

### If you don't have ModAPI yet:
Go to [https://modapi.survivetheforest.net/game/GH/](https://modapi.survivetheforest.net/game/GH/), check "SteadyAim v2" from the mods list and hit "Download". Then extract the archive, launch __ModAPI.exe__, select "Steady Aim V2" in the left menu and click "Launch the game".

----

This mod does not require any additional mods to work properly.

----

## Usage for singleplayer or host
When in game simply press the shortcut to open settings window (by default it is __NumPad5__).

Then configure aim settings like you want (for example you can set power to 0 to disable shaking completely).

## Usage for multiplayer when you are not the host
Open settings window (by default it is __NumPad5__) then click "__Ask permission__" button.

If the host answers "__Allowed__" (without quotes) in the chat you will be granted permission to use the mod.

The host doesn't need to install any mods (it works even if the host doesn't have ModAPI).

----

## Changelogs
__v2.0.0.2__: Now works in multiplayer when you are not the host.

__v2.0.0.1__: Instead of disabling shaking it now displays a settings window where you can tweak aim settings precisely.
